I'm working on building games in Golang and open sourcing my libaries. Currently most of these are in the early stages and are works in progress:
 * [Glitch](https://github.com/unitoftime/glitch) - A shader based rendering library
 * [Flow](https://github.com/unitoftime/flow) - An collection of reusable game libraries (I also sometimes use this library to prototype new things, then eventually split them to their own repo)
 * [ECS](https://github.com/unitoftime/ecs) - A generic ECS library
 * [Packer](https://github.com/unitoftime/packer) - A sprite packing library and standalone
 * [RtcNet](https://github.com/unitoftime/rtcnet) - Essentially a net.Conn wrapper for pion.WebRTC (Gives you client/server UDP-ish connections in a browser)
 * [Envoy](https://github.com/unitoftime/envoy) - A lightweight, fast, and generic bidirectional RPC framework
 * [Cod](https://github.com/unitoftime/cod) - A serdes codegen tool that scans your AST and generates fast serialization code from your structs

Here are some full games I open sourced:
 * [Boxlin](https://github.com/unitoftime/boxlin) - For Ludum Dare 53
 * I guess I only have 1 right now!
